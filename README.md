# NQueenProblem
Welcome to the N-Queen Problem GitHub project! 
This repository aims to provide multiple solutions to the classic N-Queen Problem using different algorithms, 
including Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). 
The N-Queen Problem involves placing N queens on an N x N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other, 
i.e., no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

In addition to the backtracking algorithm mentioned earlier, 
we have implemented Genetic Algorithm and PSO as alternative approaches to solving the N-Queen Problem. 
These metaheuristic algorithms provide a different perspective and can often find optimal or near-optimal solutions.

The Genetic Algorithm approach mimics the process of natural selection and evolution. 
It involves maintaining a population of candidate solutions, where each solution represents a possible configuration of queens on the chessboard. 
Through a series of selection, crossover, and mutation operations, the algorithm evolves the population over multiple generations to improve the fitness of the solutions and converge towards the optimal solution.

On the other hand, the PSO algorithm is inspired by the behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling.
It utilizes a swarm of particles, each representing a potential solution, to explore the search space. 
The particles dynamically adjust their positions and velocities based on their own best-known positions and the global best-known position in the swarm. 
This cooperative behavior enables the particles to efficiently navigate towards the optimal solution.

We encourage you to explore the code, compare the performance of different algorithms, 
and contribute to the project by suggesting improvements or new algorithmic approaches. 
Feel free to open issues for any questions, bug reports, or feature requests. We value your feedback and aim to make this project a collaborative and comprehensive resource for solving the N-Queen Problem.

Thank you for your interest in our project, and we hope you find it informative and valuable. Happy solving with Genetic Algorithm and PSO!
